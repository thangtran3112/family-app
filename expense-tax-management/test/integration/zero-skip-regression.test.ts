/**
 * Zero-skip regression guard for Phase 3C integration tests.
 *
 * Wrapped in describe.skipIf(!PHASE_3C) so it is skipped (and not counted
 * as pending/failed) when the generic `pnpm test:integration` command runs
 * without PHASE_3C_INTEGRATION=1.
 *
 * When the dedicated `test:integration:3c` command runs, PHASE_3C_INTEGRATION
 * is set to "1", the describe block executes, and the JSON inspection script
 * rejects any skipped/pending outcome as a second enforcement layer.
