# Mockups — Web UI Preflight (Phase 0F0)

> **Review reopened 2026-09-07**: These renders document the rejected combined-app direction and are not implementation-ready.
> New source of truth: `../sub-plans/phase-0i-polyglot-platform-rebaseline-design.md` and revised Phase 0F0 planning.
> Each frontend is blocked only by its matching Phase 0F0 Capture, Office, or Foundry mockup gate.

## Viewport Intent

- **Capture PWA, mobile 375px**: receipt capture, business profile, camera recovery, offline queue, quick correction, forwarding address, and curated OCR mode.
- **Capture PWA, tablet 768px**: capture plus batch review; no dense reporting or tax filing preparation.
- **Office Web, laptop 1440px**: core dashboard, ledger, businesses, projects, tax preparation, exports, forwarding controls, and plans; later mailbox/search screens use feature-specific gates.
- **Foundry Web, laptop 1440px**: platform-only providers, models, curated routes, quotas, health, and audit.

Every folder now carries `mobile-375.png`, `tablet-768.png`, `desktop-1440.png`, and an HTML source. `mockup.css` contains shared tokens, focus/touch rules, safe-area insets, and authenticated shell styling.

## Folder Index

| Folder | Screen / Route | Files (HTML interactive + 3 viewport PNG renders) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auth/` | Legacy combined auth direction | Existing renders retained as reference | Rework/split required |
| `dashboard/` | Legacy mixed dashboard | Existing renders retained as reference | Move to Office Web |
| `upload/` | Capture and batch review | Existing renders retained as reference | Rework for business profile, curated modes, quotas, and forwarding |
| `expenses-list/` | Legacy mixed ledger | Existing renders retained as reference | Split PWA recents from Office ledger |
| `expense-detail/` | Legacy mixed detail/tax edit | Existing renders retained as reference | Split quick review from Office tax review |
| `projects/` | Legacy project tax summary | Existing renders retained as reference | Remove tax identity; move to Office project analysis |
| `categories/` | Legacy single taxonomy | Existing renders retained as reference | Separate spending and tax taxonomy views |
| `settings/` | Rejected tenant/provider administration mix | Existing renders retained as reference | Replace across three applications |
| `components/` | Legacy shared component gallery | Existing renders retained as reference | Split by application responsibility |
| `pwa-mobile/` | Capture PWA interaction reference | Existing renders retained as reference | Extend with profile, quota, and forwarding states |

## Conventions

- Naming: `<screen>-<viewport>.<ext>`, e.g. `dashboard-mobile-375.png`, `dashboard-tablet-768.png`, `dashboard-desktop-1440.png`.
- Dark mode default; mobile-375 is primary for capture, tablet-768 is primary for batch correction, desktop-1440 is primary for reporting/export.
- Each folder gets a `NOTES.md` with Figma/v0/Excalidraw source URLs + open questions.
- No application code or build artifacts — `.png`, `mockup.css`, and optional standalone `.html` only.

## Rebaseline Gate Index

- [ ] **Capture gate -> Phase 0F**: Capture screen/state set approved at 375px and 768px.
- [ ] **Office gate -> Phase 0M**: Office core set approved at 1024px and 1440px; no compressed mobile dashboard/tax UI.
- [ ] **Foundry gate -> Phase 0N**: Platform-operator set approved at 1024px and 1440px.
- [ ] Each approved set passes applicable shared role, boundary, accessibility, and failure-state checks from revised Phase 0F0.

**Review:** reopened by architecture rebaseline decision, 2026-09-07; written specification still awaits approval

> Historical note: 30 legacy PNGs passed structural checks on 2026-09-06. That evidence does not approve the new three-application architecture.
